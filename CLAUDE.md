- `npx prisma migrate dev` - Create and apply new migrations in development
- `npx prisma migrate deploy` - Apply migrations in production
- `npx prisma db seed` - Seed database with initial data
- `npx prisma studio` - Open Prisma Studio for database management

## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js application that creates playlists from Stash server markers, integrating with Stash's GraphQL API for media content management.

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 15** with App Router and standalone output for Docker deployment
- **Prisma** with SQLite database for local data persistence
- **Apollo Client** for GraphQL communication with Stash server
- **Material-UI (Joy)** and **shadcn/ui** components for the interface
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

### Key Components

**User Interface:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Modern navigation bar with Material-UI icons and hover effects
- Clean navigation design with Home, Playlists, Actors, and Settings (cog icon)
- Responsive layout with smooth transitions and theme compatibility

**Data Layer:**
- `src/lib/prisma.ts` - Database client with development query logging
- `src/lib/smartPlaylistServer.ts` - Core smart playlist builder and Stash GraphQL integration
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema with Settings, Actor, Playlist, PlaylistItem, and Item models

**Playlist System:**
- Manual playlists: User-curated item collections
- Smart playlists: Auto-generated based on actor/tag/rating conditions with configurable clip timing
- Items represent video segments with start/end times, screenshots, stream URLs, and optional 1-5 star ratings

**Stash Integration:**
- Configuration via Settings table (STASH_SERVER, STASH_API) with automatic initialization
- Consistent authentication using `Authorization: Bearer` headers for GraphQL endpoints
- URL-based API key authentication for media/file endpoints (`?api_key=`)
- Connection testing endpoint with detailed error reporting and version detection
- Proxy endpoint at `/api/stash-graphql` for client-side GraphQL requests
- **Enhanced Tag Context**: `src/context/StashTagsContext.tsx` with comprehensive tag data including `child_count` and nested children for smart recommendations
- **Tag Refresh**: Manual refresh buttons available on scene editing and actor scenes pages to reload tags from Stash server without app restart

**State Management:**
- `src/app/context/SettingsContext.tsx` - Global settings context
- `src/components/ApolloProvider.tsx` - GraphQL client provider
- `src/components/MarkerTagEditor.tsx` - Reusable tag editing component with compact mode

### API Endpoints Structure
- `/api/actors` - Actor management and scene retrieval
- `/api/playlists` - CRUD operations and smart playlist generation
- `/api/playlists/[id]/items` - Playlist item management with ordering
- `/api/playlists/[id]/image` - Playlist cover image upload/delete operations
- `/api/playlist-images/[filename]` - Serve playlist images from persistent storage
- `/api/items` - Item creation and management
- `/api/items/[id]/rating` - Individual item rating GET/PATCH operations
- `/api/items/ratings` - Bulk rating lookup for multiple markers by ID
- `/api/items/filter` - Filter items by minimum rating
- `/api/settings` - Configuration management with auto-initialization and validation
- `/api/settings/test-connection` - Test Stash server connectivity and authentication
- `/api/stash-graphql` - Proxy to Stash server GraphQL

### Docker Deployment
- Multi-stage build with Prisma generation before Next.js build
- Production database at `/data/prod.db` (mounted volume)
- Playlist images stored at `/data/playlist-images/` (persistent storage)
- Automatic migration deployment and seeding via `entrypoint.sh`
- Port 3000 exposed
- Runs as non-root `nextjs` user (UID 1001) with proper file permissions for Next.js cache directories

### Smart Playlist Logic
Located in `src/lib/smartPlaylistServer.ts:buildItemsForPlaylist()`:
- Queries Stash for scene markers matching actor/tag conditions
- **Consistent Rating Filters**: Ensures items exist in database before applying rating filters
  - Creates missing items with null ratings for unrated markers
  - Only includes items with explicit ratings >= minimum threshold
  - Maintains consistency between editor preview and refresh operations
  - Uses concurrent database operations for optimal performance
- Creates video clips with configurable before/after timing around markers using settings defaults
- Generates deduped titles combining scene and marker names
- Provides preview, screenshot, and stream URLs with API key authentication

### Rating System
Comprehensive 1-5 star rating system for markers/items:
- **Database**: `rating` field in Item table (nullable integer)
- **UI Component**: `src/components/StarRating.tsx` - Interactive star rating with MUI Joy
- **Scene Management**: Rate markers directly on `/scenes/[id]` page
- **Playlist Player**: Real-time rating of currently playing clips with auto-save
- **Actor Pages**: Display existing ratings via bulk lookup API for visual feedback
